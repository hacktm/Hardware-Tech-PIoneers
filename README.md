Description
====
You take the video stream from the raspberry pi camera , do all the
image processing(in order to get the silhouette of the person) on the
raspberry itself and then send it to the led board or pc(we used pc because we did not have a giant led board). This is what you see on the pc. On the led board you would see almost the same thing
depending on the number of leds used.

It was tested and it works in real time with approx 400ms delay(on our very slow laptop). The result was also presented at the "hacktm" hackathlon contest.
