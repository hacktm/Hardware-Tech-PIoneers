III. making camera run at startup 
1.install netcat on raspberry pi: 

sudo apt-get install mplayer netcat

2. run config - set camera enable from options

3.run sudo nano /etc/rc.local  // this file contains all line commands run at startup

4. just add:
sleep(60);  // this is because after many tries,I came to the conclusion that the dongle does not have enough time to connect to pc

raspivid -t 999999 -o -| nc 192.168.1.15 5001 // or your own configured ip - this streams the video directly to the ip mentioned(present in current network) on the port 5001 in this case
